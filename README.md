# Efficient zero-shot classifier

This repository contains the experimental code for the model [MoritzLaurer/deberta-v3-zeroshot-v0.1].

The model is designed for zero-shot classification with the Hugging Face pipeline. 
The model should be substantially better at zero-shot classification than my other zero-shot models on the
Hugging Face hub. 

The model was trained on a mixture of X datasets.
1. X NLI datasets: ...
2. X classification datasets reformatted into the NLI format: ...

Note that this is only version 0.1 and I am working on several improvements (more tasks, better evaluation, ...).

### Call for input

I am looking for more datasets to train on. If you have a dataset that you think 
would be useful for zero-shot classification, please open an issue or contact me on
